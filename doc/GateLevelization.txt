To create gate level. (could use cuda to parallize... lol) (ALAP)
-Keep track of the Top Module! we need to know the PORT_Is and PORT_Os of it
-Use a BFS from the output. (top level is 0, bottom level is max height)
 -BFS down, making each place 1+ 
-Use global counter to keep track of gate widths and assign it to gate and increment.

To create gate matrix.
