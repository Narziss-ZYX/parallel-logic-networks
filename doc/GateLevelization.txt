To create gate level. (could use cuda to parallize... lol) (ALAP)
-Keep track of the Top Module! we need to know the PORT_Is and PORT_Os of it. ALSO NULL/INFINITE for starting value..
-Use a ALAP BFS from the output. (top level is 0, bottom level is max height, as late as possible BFS)
  - Possible Solution for this is use a sorted queue based on gate level of pointers to the gate.
    (this is important because. ill explain later... but doing this will keep you from unnecessarily touching each gate more than once)
    (if you touch something that is smaller than you, reevaluate, and add it to the queue and update the childern's value...
-Use global counter to keep track of gate widths and assign it to gate and increment when touched.

To create gate matrix.
